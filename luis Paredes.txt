In these 3 years I did learned so much, this scholarship was a great tool and a big opportunity in my studies and my life.
The computer class has been a time so productive and fun while we were learning.
In that time, in my first year, I have been able to learn different types of information management, I learned to do Flowchart and something used it for some school tasks. 
Also, I learned writing and reading one programming language, this language is phyton, from first year, the teacher teaches us the beginning about language of programing, Phyton. 
In that year we see and we learned some tool such as power point, word and excel; also, we edited videos with the tool of Wondershare Filmora. 
The second year, our learning was some difficult because the covid 19 pandemic arrived to the world, the things I learned and enjoy were: some programming languages such as CCS, HTML 5, JAVASCRIP and we went deep more in phyton. Also, we see Power BI.
